Hi there! My name is Abdel Rahman Emam, and I am a computer engineering graduate from Ain Shams University. I specialized in the multimedia pool, which involves the creation and manipulation of various types of digital media, including images, audio, and video.

As an aspiring learner, I am always eager to expand my knowledge and skills in the field of computer engineering. I have a passion for programming, and I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to think creatively and solve complex problems.
I now work as an SAP ABAP Developer through ehich I found passion towards ERP development, and business cycles translated technically.
